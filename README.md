# About Me

### My Life Currently:
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on many multi-faceted personal development projects that I hope one day will help to catalyze many production rready & socially responsible environments I feel most necessary for the good of all at his time. Currently these projects are in their design stage and are not yet ready to be brought to the fore.
- ðŸŒ± My current focus is on learning linux, javascript, react, express, redux, node.js, electron, three.js, webgpl, webassembly, prisma, docker, python automation, ML, and dabbling every which way in all new technologies, including edge cases, everything from creating an entire custom OS to cross platform development and development specifically for the web.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creating a new open source social media platform for many a community, and without saying too much, with one focus being on a specific subsection of the medical community.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all facets of development as it pertains to all of the above.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ People call me Jesci Ty. (Pronounced: Jessie/Jessy T.)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been reading Tarot Cards since the age of 15. The first time I ever picked them up, without ever reading a book or ever seeing even one card before, I predicted the next year and a half of my life. It scared me so much I didn't pick them back up for over a year and a half, after which all the predictions proved to be true as they all, one by one, came true. In the exact order they were even predicted. Ever since the I have held a special affinity for them as they truly opened my eyes to another very real realm! 

One day I would also like to incorperate them into my programming as well. I have a few ideas of what I'd like to build. If only there were time for them all!! If anyone feels called to rreach out on this, please do! I'd love to hear any ideas you have or even just have a spiritual chat!
