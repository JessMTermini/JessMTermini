### 🧿 Hello 👋 Everybody!! 🧿

# About Me

### My Life Currently:
- 💡 **I am currently working on** 🤹 many 🗃️ multi-faceted 💍 personal development 🧗🏋️ projects 📈📚 that I hope one day 📆 will help to 🚀 catalyze 🏹🎯 many production ready & socially 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧🦸 responsible environments I feel most necessary for the good of all life 🌱 on the planet 🌎 at this time. Currently these projects are in their design 🖌️ stage and are not yet ready to be brought to the public 🥷.
- 🧮 **My current focus** is on learning linux 🎛️🎚️, javascript ⌨️, react, express🖍️, redux, node, electron 🔋, three.js, webgl 🖲️, webassembly, prisma, docker, python 🖱️ automation, ML 🧠, and dabbling every which way in all new technologies 🧬🧪🔬🔑, including edge 🤖 cases, everything from creating an entirely new & custom ⚙️ OS to cross platform desktop 🖥️ development and of course then, development specifically for the web 🌐. I'm not so interested in mobile 📱 at this time. I think web 💻 can handle it. 
- 🤑 I’m looking to **collaborate** on creating a new open source social media platform for many a community, but without saying too much, one with focus being on a specific subsections of the medical 🩻 community.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with all facets of development as it pertains to all of the above.
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 📫 You can **reach me** on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicatermini/).
- 😁 People call me Jesci, or Jesci Ty. (Pronounced: Jessie/Jessy T./Ty/Tee)
- 🔮 **Fun fact**: I have been reading Tarot 🃏 Cards since the age of 15. The first time I ever picked them up, without ever reading a book or ever seeing even one card before, I predicted the next year and a half of my life. It scared 🤯 me so much I didn't pick them back up for over a year and a half, after which all the predictions proved to be true as they all, one by one, came true. In the exact order they were even predicted. Ever since the I have held a special affinity for them as they truly opened my eyes to another very real realm 😱👻👽! 

One day I 🧙 would also like to incorperate ✨ them 🃏 into my programming 🧑‍💻 as well. I have a few ideas of what I'd like to build. If only there were time to build them all!! **If anyone feels called 📳 to reach out 📢, please do! I'd love to hear 👂 any ideas 💡 you have or even just have a ⌨️🖱️ code 🤖 and 😇🌌🔭 spiritual 🪬 chat!!** 💯💯

- **More About Me**: I taught myself graphic 🎨🖥️ design back in 2009. I have been immersed in both design and software 💾 development since approx. 2011 when I learned how to create my very first website using plain old jquery, html and css. I am a cancer survivor and Navy ⚓ Veteran, with an expert 🏆 shot on a 9mm and 🥈 marksmith shot on a shotgun! I was born and raised in Long Island, 🗽 NY, but have also temporarily lived in both Italy 🇮🇹, & Connecticuit 🇺🇲. I loved them both. Both were very beautiful and I look forward to the day I'll be able to go back, even if just for a visit ✈️.

🧿 **🕯️🙏  Namaste! 🙏🕯️ to 🌈🌬️💨✨ YOU!** 🧿
